Bike-sharing systems are a modern twist on bike rentals, with everything automated from sign-up to return. Users can easily grab a bike at one spot and drop it off at another. They're becoming popular because they help with traffic, the environment, and health.

This dataset offers key details about bike rentals, including factors like date and time, weather, and holidays. It provides hourly rental data over a two-year period. For this competition, the training set includes data from the first 19 days of each month, while the test set covers the 20th to the end of the month.

This project uses regression algorithms to predict the hourly bike rental counts in the test set based on prior data. We'll evaluate models using the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) to choose the most accurate one.
